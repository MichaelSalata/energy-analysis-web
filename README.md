Energy Use Info
-----------------------

To aid in preparing for an HVAC upgrade, this project gathers and cleans **Meteostat weather data** & **ComEd energy meter data**. It then quantifies the impact the weather has on our HVAC system.

- The original Jupyter Notebooks that did the cleaning and analysis and can be found in the [Energy_Use_Info](https://github.com/MichaelSalata/Energy_Use_Info) repository.

- This streamlit project reanalyzes and visualizes and the cleaned data from the Jupyter notebooks.

- The live streamlit community hosted version can be found at [energy-analysis-web.streamlit.app](https://energy-analysis-web.streamlit.app/). It may take a minute to load.
