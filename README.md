Energy Use Info
-----------------------
To aid in preparing for an HVAC upgrade, this project gathers and cleans **Meteostat weather data** & **ComEd energy meter data**. It then quantifies the impact the weather has on our HVAC system.

- The original Jupyter Notebooks that did the cleaning and analysis and can be found in the [Energy_Use_Info](https://github.com/MichaelSalata/Energy_Use_Info) repository.

- This streamlit project reanalyzes and visualizes and the cleaned data from the Jupyter notebooks.
